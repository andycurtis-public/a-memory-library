     *    that exceeded the initial allocation. The memory of previous allocations may still be
     *    valid, but should not be relied upon.
     *
     * 2. aml_pool_destroy(pool): This completely destroys the pool and frees all memory associated
     *    with it in one operation.
     *
     * The best way to reclaim all allocated memory in one operation is to call aml_pool_destroy().
